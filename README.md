## How to Play

### Getting Started
1. Click the "Attack!" button to deal damage to monsters
2. Kill monsters to earn gold
3. Use gold to hire and upgrade heroes
4. Heroes automatically deal DPS even when you're not clicking

### Progression
- **Zones**: Progress through zones by killing 10 monsters per zone
- **Monsters**: Each zone has 5 different monsters that cycle
- **Bosses**: Every 5th zone features a boss with 10x HP and gold reward
- **Heroes**: Unlock stronger heroes as you progress and earn more gold

### Hero System
- **Hiring**: Hire heroes with gold to start dealing automatic DPS
- **Upgrading**: Upgrade heroes to increase their DPS contribution
- **Cost Scaling**: Each upgrade costs more (7% increase per level)
- **Progressive Unlocks**: New heroes unlock as you can afford them

### Ascension (Late Game)
- **Requirement**: Reach Zone 100 to unlock ascension
- **Hero Souls**: Gain Hero Souls based on how far past Zone 100 you've progressed
- **Permanent Bonus**: Each Hero Soul provides +10% DPS bonus that persists through ascensions
- **Reset**: Ascension resets your progress but keeps Hero Soul bonuses

### Tips for Success
1. **Balance clicking and heroes**: Early game relies on clicking, late game on hero DPS
2. **Upgrade efficiently**: Focus on your highest DPS heroes first
3. **Don't rush ascension**: Go as far as possible before ascending for maximum Hero Souls
4. **Check back regularly**: The game continues to progress with hero DPS when you're away
